# Mini-project-in-C
An RPG, Escape game with in game puzzles and surprises to help the Player escape the EVIL!!
This game was planned to contain logics from popular games like Minesweeper and have a story telling similar to that of a Chill's Art game.The game starts off with the first person view of the player waking up in the kidnapper's lair. Why was the player kidnapped? How were they kidnapped? Who even is the player? Though these questions arent answered in this version of the game, I am plannin on upskilling myself to create games people would appreciate someday. The future Versions of the game will include (hopefully) image and audio files for better UI/UX and a stronger understanding of the plot. Sadly, no one at class understood minesweeper, and deadlines ran fast. I am open to discussions and resourses that can help me understand the features available in C language.
